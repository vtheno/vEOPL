** This is my learning EOPL [Essentials of Programming Languages] note.
*** This is some code from
    - Lexical code from ML4Wokrs [ML for the Working Programer]
    - Parser code learning from CSC447 [klee.cs.depaul.edu csc447 lecture 7 Parsing]
*** use the Lexical and Parser to replace EOPL SLLGEN
